Redis Queue is an uber simple queueing system built on top of redis.

Queues are created when values are added to it. All input is serialised into JSON and stored and all output from the queue is also JSON.

Dependencies:
* Ruby
* gem install redis SystemTimer yajl

Performance:

Not written for really high throughput, but see test/performance.rb.
100,000 values stored and retrieved in 23s: ~8k/s read/write
